# Project: Encrypted Dual-Cloud Auditing


## Description
The project is designed based on AES-CTR mode and focuses on implementing a dual-cloud auditing system. Unlike the AES-CTR mode, this system performs multiplication operations on plaintext in a finite field before XORing with a random sequence. The resulting data digest generated by the dual-cloud system possesses homomorphic properties.Please put the outsourced file, such as 1.txt, in the dir `data`.

## Project Environment
- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
- Development Tool: VS code
- CPU Requirement: SSE2 instruction set support

## Dependencies
`sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
`sudo apt-get install libcrypto++-dev`
