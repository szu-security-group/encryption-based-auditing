# Project: Encrypted Dual-Cloud Auditing


## Description
The project is designed based on AES-CTR mode and focuses on implementing a dual-cloud auditing system. Unlike the AES-CTR mode, this system performs multiplication operations on plaintext in a finite field before XORing with a random sequence. The resulting data digest generated by the dual-cloud system possesses homomorphic properties.

## Project Environment
- Operating System: Windows 10
- Development Tool: Visual Studio 2022
- CPU Requirement: SSE2 instruction set support

## Dependencies
The project relies on the Crypto++ library, [version 870](https://www.cryptopp.com/release870.html).

## License
The project is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
